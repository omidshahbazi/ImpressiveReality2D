 Introduction

 sal.h provides a set of annotations to describe how a function uses its
 parameters - the assumptions it makes about them, and the guarantees it makes
 upon finishing.

 Annotations may be placed before either a function parameter's type or its return
 type, and describe the function's behavior regarding the parameter or return value.
 There are two classes of annotations: buffer annotations and advanced annotations.
 Buffer annotations describe how functions use their pointer parameters, and
 advanced annotations either describe complex/unusual buffer behavior, or provide
 additional information about a parameter that is not otherwise expressible.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Buffer Annotations

 The most important annotations in sal.h provide a consistent way to annotate
 buffer parameters or return values for a function. Each of these annotations describes
 a single buffer (which could be a string, a fixed-length or variable-length array,
 or just a pointer) that the function interacts with: where it is, how large it is,
 how much is initialized, and what the function does with it.

 The appropriate macro for a given buffer can be constructed using the table below.
 Just pick the appropriate values from each category, and combine them together
 with a leading underscore. Some combinations of values do not make sense as buffer
 annotations. Only meaningful annotations can be added to your code; for a list of
 these, see the buffer annotation definitions section.

 Only a single buffer annotation should be used for each parameter.

 |------------|------------|---------|--------|----------|----------|---------------|

 Level: Describes the buffer pointer's level of indirection from the parameter or
          return value 'p'.

 <>         : p is the buffer pointer.
 _deref     : *p is the buffer pointer. p must not be NULL.
 _deref_opt : *p may be the buffer pointer. p may be NULL, in which case the rest of
                the annotation is ignored.

 Usage: Describes how the function uses the buffer.

 <>     : The buffer is not accessed. If used on the return value or with _deref, the
            function will provide the buffer, and it will be uninitialized at exit.
            Otherwise, the caller must provide the buffer. This should only be used
            for alloc and free functions.
 _in    : The function will only read from the buffer. The caller must provide the
            buffer and initialize it. Cannot be used with _deref.
 _out   : The function will only write to the buffer. If used on the return value or
            with _deref, the function will provide the buffer and initialize it.
            Otherwise, the caller must provide the buffer, and the function will
            initialize it.
 _inout : The function may freely read from and write to the buffer. The caller must
            provide the buffer and initialize it. If used with _deref, the buffer may
            be reallocated by the function.

 Size: Describes the total size of the buffer. This may be less than the space actually
         allocated for the buffer, in which case it describes the accessible amount.

 <>      : No buffer size is given. If the type specifies the buffer size (such as
             with LPSTR and LPWSTR), that amount is used. Otherwise, the buffer is one
             element long. Must be used with _in, _out, or _inout.
 _ecount : The buffer size is an explicit element count.
 _bcount : The buffer size is an explicit byte count.

 Output: Describes how much of the buffer will be initialized by the function. For
           _inout buffers, this also describes how much is initialized at entry. Omit this
           category for _in buffers; they must be fully initialized by the caller.

 <>    : The type specifies how much is initialized. For instance, a function initializing
           an LPWSTR must NULL-terminate the string.
 _full : The function initializes the entire buffer.
 _part : The function initializes part of the buffer, and explicitly indicates how much.

 NullTerm: States if the present of a '\0' marks the end of valid elements in the buffer.
 _z    : A '\0' indicated the end of the buffer
 _nz	 : The buffer may not be null terminated and a '\0' does not indicate the end of the
          buffer.
 Optional: Describes if the buffer itself is optional.

 <>   : The pointer to the buffer must not be NULL.
 _opt : The pointer to the buffer might be NULL. It will be checked before being dereferenced.

 Parameters: Gives explicit counts for the size and length of the buffer.

 <>            : There is no explicit count. Use when neither _ecount nor _bcount is used.
 (size)        : Only the buffer's total size is given. Use with _ecount or _bcount but not _part.
 (size,length) : The buffer's total size and initialized length are given. Use with _ecount_part
                   and _bcount_part.

 Buffer Annotation Examples

 LWSTDAPI_(BOOL) StrToIntExA(
     LPCSTR pszString,                    -- No annotation required, const implies __in.
     DWORD dwFlags,
     __out int *piRet                     -- A pointer whose dereference will be filled in.
 );

 void MyPaintingFunction(
     __in HWND hwndControl,               -- An initialized read-only parameter.
     __in_opt HDC hdcOptional,            -- An initialized read-only parameter that might be NULL.
     __inout IPropertyStore *ppsStore     -- An initialized parameter that may be freely used
                                          --   and modified.
 );

 LWSTDAPI_(BOOL) PathCompactPathExA(
     __out_ecount(cchMax) LPSTR pszOut,   -- A string buffer with cch elements that will
                                          --   be NULL terminated on exit.
     LPCSTR pszSrc,                       -- No annotation required, const implies __in.
     UINT cchMax,
     DWORD dwFlags
 );

 HRESULT SHLocalAllocBytes(
     size_t cb,
     __deref_bcount(cb) T **ppv           -- A pointer whose dereference will be set to an
                                          --   uninitialized buffer with cb bytes.
 );

 __inout_bcount_full(cb) : A buffer with cb elements that is fully initialized at
     entry and exit, and may be written to by this function.

 __out_ecount_part(count, *countOut) : A buffer with count elements that will be
     partially initialized by this function. The function indicates how much it
     initialized by setting *countOut.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Advanced Annotations

 Advanced annotations describe behavior that is not expressible with the regular
 buffer macros. These may be used either to annotate buffer parameters that involve
 complex or conditional behavior, or to enrich existing annotations with additional
 information.

 __success(expr) f :
     <expr> indicates whether function f succeeded or not. If <expr> is true at exit,
     all the function's guarantees (as given by other annotations) must hold. If <expr>
     is false at exit, the caller should not expect any of the function's guarantees
     to hold. If not used, the function must always satisfy its guarantees. Added
     automatically to functions that indicate success in standard ways, such as by
     returning an HRESULT.

 __nullterminated p :
     Pointer p is a buffer that may be read or written up to and including the first
     NULL character or pointer. May be used on typedefs, which marks valid (properly
     initialized) instances of that type as being NULL-terminated.

 __nullnullterminated p :
     Pointer p is a buffer that may be read or written up to and including the first
     sequence of two NULL characters or pointers. May be used on typedefs, which marks
     valid instances of that type as being double-NULL terminated.

 __reserved v :
     Value v must be 0/NULL, reserved for future use.

 __checkReturn v :
     Return value v must not be ignored by callers of this function.

 __typefix(ctype) v :
     Value v should be treated as an instance of ctype, rather than its declared type.

 __override f :
     Specify C#-style 'override' behaviour for overriding virtual methods.

 __callback f :
     Function f can be used as a function pointer.

 __format_string p :
     Pointer p is a string that contains % markers in the style of printf.

 __blocksOn(resource) f :
     Function f blocks on the resource 'resource'.

 __fallthrough :
     Annotates switch statement labels where fall-through is desired, to distinguish
     from forgotten break statements.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Advanced Annotation Examples

 __success(return == TRUE) LWSTDAPI_(BOOL) 
 PathCanonicalizeA(__out_ecount(MAX_PATH) LPSTR pszBuf, LPCSTR pszPath) :
     pszBuf is only guaranteed to be NULL-terminated when TRUE is returned.

 typedef __nullterminated WCHAR* LPWSTR : Initialized LPWSTRs are NULL-terminated strings.

 __out_ecount(cch) __typefix(LPWSTR) void *psz : psz is a buffer parameter which will be
     a NULL-terminated WCHAR string at exit, and which initially contains cch WCHARs.
